This is my exercise file from the LinkedIn Learning course "Using SQL with C++" by Bill Weinman


## Using this Repositary
1. In `sqlcpp.h`, change the DB_PATH macro into the path you have your database or want them to be stored.
2. Run the following command
```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
```
```cmd
cmake ..
``` 
3. Open the created project file depending on the IDE of your choice
